on the sample database chinook.db from https://sqlitetutorial.net yields a
FOREIGN KEY sqlite schema command. Explore this:
https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-foreign-key/

Regarding handling the sqlite database, you'll need to create multiple tables
for any field that has more than one value (population, areas). This will use a
foreign key, here is the output in ChatGPT:

A foreign key is a field within a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a link between the data in two tables. So, in the context of your example, if you had a table called "senators" with a primary key "id" and you wanted to link the data in the "states" table to the data in the "senators" table, you would add a foreign key "senator_id" to the "states" table that references the "id" primary key in the "senators" table. This way, you can associate multiple senators with a single state by having multiple rows in the "states" table with the same state name but different senator_id foreign keys.
